I came across the following coordinate systems:
1. Cartesian Coordinate systems
        There is no relationship between points in cartesian coordinate systems. It is just a point on the coordinate space.

2. Vector Coordinate systems - Uses degrees
        *** A point is always with respect to the origin. 
        *** There is always a connecteness between a point and the origin. This makes it easy to traverse around the space.
        Ways to define vectors - r∠θ - (x,y)
        r∠θ - magnitude and angle (degrees)
        (x,y) - component along x, component along y 

        x = r * cos(θ)
        y = r * sin(θ)

        r = √(x^2 + y^2)
        θ = inverse of tan(y/x)

        >> 2D vectors, 3D vector coordinate systems
3. Polar Coordinate systems - Uses radians 
        Ways to define polars - r∠θ
        r∠θ - magnitude and angle (radians)

        ** Using radians make polars different from vector coordinate systems
        >> 3D polar coordinate systems is called Spherical Coordinate systems
        
        In mathematics, a spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system for three-dimensional space where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: the radial distance of that point from a fixed origin, its polar angle measured from a fixed zenith direction, and the azimuthal angle of its orthogonal projection on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane. It can be seen as the three-dimensional version of the polar coordinate system.

        The radial distance is also called the radius or radial coordinate. The polar angle may be called colatitude, zenith angle, normal angle, or inclination angle.

        When radius is fixed, the two angular coordinates make a coordinate system on the sphere sometimes called spherical polar coordinates.

        The use of symbols and the order of the coordinates differs among sources and disciplines. This article will use the ISO convention[1] frequently encountered in physics:  (r, θ, φ) gives the radial distance, polar angle, and azimuthal angle.

5. Geographic Coordinate Systems 
6. Spiral coordinate systems - Can be grouped into Polar Coordinate systems
