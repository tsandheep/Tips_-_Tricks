Quick Review

☛ Initializaing git
> git init

☛ Adding a remote repository
To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPO>.git
# Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/USER/REPO.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USER/REPO.git (push)


☛ Changing a remote repository's URL
The git remote set-url command changes an existing remote repository URL.
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

☛ Git reset Usage and file specific commits
If you have modified multiple files in the repository and want to commit each file with a separate commit message:
1. Do not use (git add .), because this will add all the modified files to the staging area
2. If you had added all files to the staging area, use (git reset) to unstage all or (git reset <<specific-file>>)
3. Then, use (git add <<specific-file>>) to stage it, (git commit -m "the-comment") to add the changes to your local repository, and (git push) to push to the remote repository.

☛ Difference between commit and push
Git commit adds changes to your local repository, here no connection with your remote repo .
Git push connects to remote repo and adds your changes, so when you do pull you will get latest updated .
